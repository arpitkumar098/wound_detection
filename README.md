# 🩺 Wound Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Objective
To develop a machine learning-based system for **automated wound detection and classification** using image processing and deep learning techniques. This project aims to support early diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals in treatment decisions.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Custom-collected** or publicly available wound image dataset.
- Contains images of various wound types (e.g., abrasion, ulcer, burn, surgical wounds).
- Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy, Pandas
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (CNN model)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
  - Dropout → Dense layers
- Final layer: Softmax (multi-class classification)

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Noise removal, resizing, edge detection (OpenCV)
2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Using convolutional filters and color histograms
3. **Model Training**
   - CNN trained on labeled wound images
4. **Prediction & Diagnosis**
   - Output wound category with confidence score
5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix

## 📷 Sample Output

| Original Image | Detected Class |
|----------------|----------------|
| ![wound1](images/sample1.jpg) | Abrasion |
| ![wound2](images/sample2.jpg) | Burn |

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved classification accuracy of **92.3%** on test data.
- Model generalizes well on unseen wound images.
- Potential for real-time mobile-based diagnosis.

---

## 💡 Future Scope
- Integration with mobile apps or Raspberry Pi for field use.
- Add severity level grading.
- Extend to diabetic wounds or pressure ulcers.
